        Darlington Dolphin Masters ASC was established almost 30 years ago and is a friendly club with approximately 40 members.

The club is affiliated to Swim England.

We welcome swimmers aged 18 years and over who want to train in a club environment, and we cater for most levels from fitness swimmers looking to improve, to strong competitive masters swimmers.

There are a number of triathletes and very keen open water swimmers within the club, and regularly meet on an informal basis, usually at Ellerton lake.
