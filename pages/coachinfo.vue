                    bio="Iain (left of photo) and Glen (right) have been coaching together for the past 11 years and have more than 30 years swimming coaching experience combined. They have coached primarily at grass roots and age group levels with great success, producing county, regional and national champions as well as a Team GB swimmer at the European Junior Championships.
 Their swimming philosophy is both simple and effective; swim fast! They train to race and believe in swimming at the right rate at the right time. Technically focussed, they place a big emphasis on quality over quantity.
 Their fun but serious attitudes are evident on poolside and will look to improve each swimmer’s technical, speed and endurance abilities.
 Always up for a challenge themselves, Iain & Glen have swam the English channel (Glen twice) and many open water long distance events. Iain has competed at the European and World Masters Championships." />
